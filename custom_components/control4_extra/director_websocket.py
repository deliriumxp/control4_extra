"""Director WebSocket client that survives reconnects (pyControl4 #62).

pyControl4 2.0.2's ``C4Websocket.sio_connect`` has two failure modes, both reproduced
against a fake Director (self-signed TLS, Engine.IO v3 / Socket.IO v2):

- without a session it passes ``ssl_verify=False``, and engineio calls
  ``ssl.create_default_context()`` inside the event loop on every connect and every
  automatic reconnect attempt (the blocking call HA reports in #62);
- with HA's no-verify session the first connect is clean, but after any drop engineio's
  ``_reset()`` closes its session and the next attempt opens a bare
  ``aiohttp.ClientSession()``, which rejects the Director's self-signed certificate.
  Reconnects fail silently until the next ``sio_connect()`` (the daily token refresh).

The engineio client below always (re)binds its HTTP session to the caller's connector, so
the connector's pre-built no-verify SSL context is used on every attempt and nothing
builds an SSL context in the loop. Disconnecting also stops a pending reconnect loop.
